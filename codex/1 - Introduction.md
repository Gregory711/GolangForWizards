# 1 - Introduction

## 1.1 - Discovery

I had been searching for the Order of Gophers for years. They were a group of wizards who were said to have mastered the ancient programming language Go. Go was created by the Google School of Magic, and it was said to be the most powerful programming language ever created. I had heard that the Order had created a magic tome that contained powerful spells written in Go. I was determined to find the tome and learn its secrets.

One day, I came across a set of ruins that I had never seen before. The ruins were covered in strange runes that I could not understand. I began to investigate, and soon I found a hidden chamber. Inside the chamber, I found a magic tome. The cover of the tome was inscribed with the words "Order of Gophers". I opened the tome and began to read.

The spells in the tome were written in Go. I had never seen anything like it before. The spells were powerful and versatile, and they could be used to create all sorts of magical effects. I was amazed. I had finally found what I was looking for.

I knew that the Order of Gophers had created the tome for a reason. They wanted to use it to help people and make the world a better place. I vowed to use the tome in the same way.

I took the tome and returned to my home. I would study it carefully and learn everything I could about Go. I was ready to begin my new journey as a wizard of Go.

## 1.2 - Further Inspection

All of what I knew of Go up to that point was rumors passed from wizard to wizard. Once I returned to my camp I set about to finding out just what made Go so powerful.

Upon skimming through the book I made a list. Go had built-in concurrent programming support, container types map and slice as first-class citizens, polymorphism through interfaces, value boxing and reflection through interfaces, pointers, function closures, methods, deferred function calls, type embedding and deduction, memory safety, automatic garbage collection, cross-platform capabilities, and generics. 

Further reading convinced me of the clean and simple nature of the language along with its syntactical similarity to other languages which made it easy for me to quickly get up to speed.

What most impressed me however was how it managed to add in features mostly seen in spell languages that are cast dynamically with this compiled language.

Additionally the compile time was blazingly fast meaning I could get my spells ready quick and have short development cycles to improve on them. It even had quick warm up times for conjuring meaning I can put my spells on my AWS Lambda scrolls and cast them almost immediately when needed.
