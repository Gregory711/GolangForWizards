# Golang For Wizards

This repository houses a collection of journal entries by a wizard as he learns the programming language Go along with the programs he conjures.

## Motivation

I created this repository as a way of teaching myself how to write Go web REST endpoints and leaving behind documentation for myself and anyone else who may find it useful or entertaining. I chose this somewhat peculiar learning style for two reasons. First off, I'm a big believer in practice makes perfect and that the best way to ensure you practice something is to make it fun (this is perhaps best demonstrated in the realm of fitness where the most active people also tend to enjoy the process). The other reason is that I think this will be a far more challenging and memorable way of learning than just the regular watching videos and writing CRUD apps.

## Format and Goals

This repository is split into two folders; spells and codex. Spells folders contains the projects that are written during the wizards adventures. The wizards adventures are documented in the codex which is half story half documentation. The codex entries will closely follows the contents of go101.org along with supplemental information on writing REST endpoints, deploying to AWS Lambda, testing practices, functional programming in Go, and any other things I want to learn to do in Go. Each entry will roughly follow the STAR acronym (Situation, Tasks, Action, Results).

## Tools

The code of course will all be written in Go. The codex entries will be written in markdown and have images or SVG's which will be edited using Penpot. The endpoints will be deployed to AWS Lambda using the Serverless framework. Finally, the codex entries will be written in the style of a wizard by using chatbots including Google's Bard.
